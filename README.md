# SHAPE-SAS-Variability
Study on Subharmonic Aided Pressure Estimation (SHAPE), focusing on variability of subharmonic amplitude signals. 
This repository provides the microbubble population model and experimental data analysis, supporting the manuscripts "Towards Reliable Subharmonic-Aided Pressure Estimation: Simulation and Experimental Validation of Microbubble Dynamics" submitted to Applied Acoustics.

The manuscipt aims at exploring the variability of subharmonic amplitude signals generally observed in experiments. A microbubble population model was built to investigate the impacts of bubble distribution and bubble interactions within polydisperse microbubble populations. The simulations verified that bubble distribution in both size and locations contributed to the variability of subharmonic amplitude signals. SHAPE sensitivity is also influenced with varying bubble distribution.

The main program is population2.m, which provides the simulation of microbubble populations. Even though two-dimensional models is also supported in this program, one-dimensional model is highly recommended because of the computational burden.

Multiple plotting scripts are also provided, which generates the figures in the manuscriots. 

Simulation data are also provided for instant generation of the figures.
